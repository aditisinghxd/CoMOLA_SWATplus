### About
CoMOLA (Constrained Multi-objective Optimisation of Land use Allocation) is a free Python tool for optimising land use allocation for multiple objectives. It is based on the open source Python library "inspyred" and includes functions for handling land use maps within genetic algorithms (GA, NSGA-II). In its basic form (https://github.com/michstrauch/CoMOLA), CoMOLA can be used immediately by inputting a raster map representing status quo land use, ready-to-run models written in R, including their input data, and (optional) information on constraints. In this release, CoMOLA is coupled with the integrated watershed model SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, https://swat.tamu.edu/). A comprehensive manual on the use of CoMOLA_SWATplus is available at https://zenodo.org/records/11473793).
